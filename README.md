# Image-recognition-using-TensorFlow
This is a basic neural network that predicts the class for the given images. We use a preloaded dataset in Keras which contains images of various clothing items.
We use a three-layer basic neural network with activation functions *rectified linear unit* and *softmax* in second and third layers respectively.
